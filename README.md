=========

This is My macbook config files.These files contain VIM Config,bash profile,node.js and some other framework installation.Because of the slow transfer assistant on Mac.I suppose that I should build this Repo.:-)


How To Use It
============

git clone https://github.com/lbj96347/MacConfig.git

* Get folder : MacConfig
* cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
* mv ( or cp ) vim ~/.vim ( Remember to see whether there is a .vim folder in you directory.This step would help you to install some vim plugins )
* cp bash_profile ~/.bash_profile ( For the command line config , I recommand iterm2 in Mac OSX)
* in vimrc line 32 : set syntax=jade , this means I am using Jade template language.If you wanna know how to install Jade sytax.Pliz follow this link : http://1.cashwordpress.sinaapp.com/?p=319 Sorry just offer Chinese guide :-( )
